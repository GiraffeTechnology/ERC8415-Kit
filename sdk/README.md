# SDK

Two clients for the Kit's projection API — one JavaScript, one Python. Both
keep the standard's three questions as three calls, and neither offers a single
collapsed status, because a caller handed one value cannot tell which question
it was answered.

## The three questions

| Question | Call | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Who did the register confirm at instant *t*? | `holderAsOf` / `holder_as_of` | Raises for an instant the projection does not cover. |
| Can a later admission still change that? | `isFinalAsOf` / `is_final_as_of` | Never raises; answers `false` for an uncovered instant. |
| Is a change in flight? | `openGapOf` / `open_gap_of` | `null` / `None` when no gap is open, including on a contract without settlement conformance. |

Acting on the holder without reading finality acts for the wrong party when a
later admission supersedes the answer. The standard names this the most likely
integration error, because the entry resolves either way.

## JavaScript

```ts
import { ProjectionClient, NotCoveredError } from './sdk/js/index.ts';

const client = new ProjectionClient({ baseUrl: 'https://kit.example' });

const holder = await client.holderAsOf(1n, 1_700_000_000n);
const settled = await client.isFinalAsOf(1n, 1_700_000_000n);

if (!settled) {
  // The answer may still move. Whether to wait, hold consideration or proceed
  // is the transaction terms' call, not the Kit's.
}
```

All three at once, each still labelled as itself:

```ts
const { holder, final, openGap } = await client.resolve(1n, 1_700_000_000n);
```

Instants, versions and token ids are `bigint`. They cross the wire as decimal
strings and are never parsed into a JSON number, because a silently rounded
instant resolves to the wrong entry.

## Python

Standard library only — nothing to install.

```python
from erc8415 import ProjectionClient, NotCoveredError

client = ProjectionClient("https://kit.example")

holder = client.holder_as_of(1, 1_700_000_000)
settled = client.is_final_as_of(1, 1_700_000_000)

resolution = client.resolve(1, 1_700_000_000)
resolution.holder, resolution.final, resolution.open_gap
```

## Errors

| Condition | JavaScript | Python |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Instant precedes the first entry | `NotCoveredError` | `NotCoveredError` |
| Unknown token or version | `ProjectionClientError` with `code` | `ProjectionClientError` with `.code` |

An uncovered instant is not a failure of the query: it means the projection
does not cover that instant. It is a distinct error type so a caller can tell
it apart from a transport or conformance problem, and never confuse it with an
answer.

## Reading, then acting

These clients read over HTTP, which means an answer can move between the read
and whatever a caller does with it. That is fine for display and indexing.

A contract acting on a projection answer should call the contract in the same
transaction as the action that depends on it. That closes the window entirely
rather than narrowing it. Do not cache a read across transactions.

## Tests

```sh
npm test                          # includes the JavaScript SDK against a live server
python3 sdk/python/test_client.py # the Python suite standalone
```

`resolve` uses one `/projection/{tokenId}/resolve/as-of/{instant}` request,
returning holder, finality and open gap from one synchronous server snapshot.
This is a display snapshot, not a guarantee across a subsequent transaction.
Contracts must still read and act atomically in the same transaction.
