 *
 * - it cannot block a transfer. There is no transfer here to block, and an
 *   open gap is a record beside the projection, never a lock on it;
 * - it cannot finalise anything. Opening, cancelling, expiring and closing a
 *   gap all leave `isFinalAsOf` exactly where it was;
 * - it cannot reject an entry. There is no rejection path: an admission that
 *   does not verify never becomes an entry, and one that does is permanent.
